<p>A nice little framework which hides some of the "complexity" of pygame. To be used for teaching game programming to two kids.</p>
<p>The idea is that the student only ever writes code in the game.py file. setup\_game.py takes care of creating the display, while main.py calls the functions int game.py</p>
